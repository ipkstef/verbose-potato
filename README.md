# TCG Pricing Calculator Web App

A modern web application for automated pricing calculation of trading card games. This app processes CSV files containing TCG market data and calculates optimal store pricing based on market conditions and inventory levels.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Automated Pricing Logic**: Calculates store prices based on market data and inventory levels
- ðŸ“ˆ **Real-time Processing**: Upload CSV files and get instant results
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient design with smooth animations
- ðŸ“¥ **Download Results**: Export processed data as CSV files
- ðŸ“Š **Summary Statistics**: View key metrics and price change analysis

## How It Works

The application processes two CSV files:

1. **previous.csv**: Contains historical pricing data and inventory levels
2. **current.csv**: Contains current market data and pricing information

The pricing algorithm:
- Calculates base prices from market and low prices
- Adjusts multipliers based on inventory changes
- Applies quantity-based pricing bumps
- Generates summary statistics and downloadable results

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/process

Processes uploaded CSV files and returns pricing calculations.

**Request**:
- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Body: Form data with `previous_file` and `current_file`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": {
    "total_items": 150,
    "avg_market_price": 12.50,
    "avg_store_price": 15.75,

## Pricing Algorithm

The application implements a sophisticated pricing algorithm:

1. **Base Price Calculation**: Uses the minimum of market price and low price
2. **Multiplier Adjustment**: 
   - Increases by 0.01 if inventory increased
   - Decreases by 0.05 if multiplier > 1.05
   - Decreases by 0.01 otherwise
3. **Quantity Bumps**:
   - 40+ items: +$0.05
   - 20-39 items: +$0.15
   - <20 items: +$0.25

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Performance

- **File Size Limit**: 16MB per file
- **Processing Time**: Typically <5 seconds for files up to 10,000 rows
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for Cloudflare's serverless environment
